Calculation of Bernoulli numbers by Srinivasa Ramanujan method. Limited to the first 17 Bernoulli numbers due to the datatype limit.

Ada Lovelace used punchcards to calculate Bernoulli numbers and that way became the world first computer programmer, so therefore 
it was obvious to do this little Bernoulli number execise in Ada.

NOTE: Number_Theory_Tools.adb and Number_Theory_Tools.ads is needed to compile
